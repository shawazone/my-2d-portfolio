# 🎮 Interactive Portfolio Game

An immersive **2D pixel-art portfolio** built as a game using **Kaboom.js**, **React**, and **Vite**.  
Instead of scrolling a traditional website, visitors **explore a world**, interact with objects, and discover projects, skills, and information through gameplay and dialogue.

---

## 🧠 Concept

This project reimagines a personal portfolio as a **top-down RPG-style experience**:

- Walk around outdoor and indoor maps
- Enter buildings and rooms
- Interact with objects to trigger dialogue
- Learn about projects, skills, and background organically
- Enjoy ambient music and sound effects for immersion

It’s a portfolio you **play**, not just read.
